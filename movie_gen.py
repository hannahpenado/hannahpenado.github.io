## start backend knowledge of genres and movies through dictionary and
## hash map for movie values 

    ## first want to create basic dictionary with keys as genres and 
    ## values as movies
        ##movie genres ie romance, action, horror, comedy, scifi, and drama


    ## want to map out the values for selected movies
        ## need to map out the rating values of the movies

        ## need to map out the time length of movies
        
        ## need to map out actors for each movie
    
    ## create a stack function that can sort through and pop listed values
    ## and return the movie name
 
## get input from user
    ## get input for movie genre first letter
        ## check if they meant that genre y/n

    ## want to create a stack or a queue for the movie genres and scope 
        ## then pop the top values for the movies

    ## ask user if they want to look at another genre y/n
        ## yes = loop through again for stacks and hasing out
            ## count user genres looked at, if more than 6 genres seen ask 
            ## and tell this
                ## that's all the genres we have and ask if they'd like to 
                ## see a genre again
                

        ## no = end program
    
## thank user and end program
